# kwplanner
Keyword planner using Google Adwords API


## How to use
1) Clone the repo

2) Install the required packages
```
cd kwplanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Place the credentials file (auth.yaml) in your home directory. The script assumes that the file is named ```auth.yaml``` and is located in the home directory. You can use a different name and location but you have to input that information every time you run the script.


4) Run the program. For example, you want to check the __US__ volume estimates of the __English__ keywords in a file named __keywords.txt__ and located in your home directory.
```
python kwplanner -country_code US -language English -keyword_file ./conf/keywords.txt

```

The script now expects the input file to have a header where one column is labeled "keyword". It fetches the searchvolume for the keywords contained in that column.
The result will be saved inside the ```kwplanner``` folder.

```
Extra parameters:
  -output_name  OUTPUT_NAME    : OUTPUT_NAME is the name and location of the output file. The default will be result_{date and time}. You can specify whatever you want, for example: ~/out.txt

  -auth_file AUTH_FILE         : AUTH_FILE is the location of the file that contains the credential  information.
                                 By default it is ~/auth.yaml.
